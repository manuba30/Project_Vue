first of all , I wrote the most part of my comments in french because I do my studies in France so it s a french formation.
You will eventually found some comments in portuguese and english.
I declared the most part of the time the variables, functions , etc , in english to habituate myself using a universal professional language so I can best structurate the code and the bases.
Previously I had a code here (that had some nomenclature problem) caused of a merge with a previously code in another branch, so now I believe that everything is working.

Thanks for reading , hope that it can explain the language misture and the reason of some problems.
